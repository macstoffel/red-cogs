# red-cogs

## These are my personal cogs for Discord Red-Bot.Just made to experiment with some ideas

---
> prutser - assign a role to block a user from participating in counting
> 
> timematchcog - for alerting my kids to touch the ground
> 
> voiceping - made to let anyone know there is a voice-channel opened (and closed) so people can join
